### Target Discovery Platform

Our Target Discovery Platform (TDP) is designed to build web-based applications for the visual data analysis process. It provides a plugin and extension mechanism to extend its core capabilities and build rich applications that suit all needs. Futhermore it offers provenance tracking for reproducibility, such that applications building on the TDP support this tracking user actions, too. The TDP also provides a mapping mechanism between different identifiers of the same entities (e.g. Ensembl IDs and Gene Symbols) such that mappings between them can easily be resolved.
