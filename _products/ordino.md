#### Data-driven prioritization of genes, cell lines and tissues

Ordino is an [open source](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz009/5292316) visual data analysis solution for visualizing and ranking tabular data. It computes scores based on different parameters, ranks and filters them to subsequently identify new analysis targets.<br />The software has been initially developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and Johannes Kepler University Linz (JKU) as part of a research collaboration. As a JKU spin-off company, datavisyn continuously extends the tool and offers to roll out and maintain the software.
